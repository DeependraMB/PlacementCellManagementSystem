        Department of Placement and Training caters for enhancing not only the employability skills of the passing out 
        Amalites but also the overall development of their personality. The dept. organizes on-campus and off-campus 
        recruitments and pre-placement training programmes through Aptitude tests, Group Discussions, Interviews and 
        presentation skills in collaboration with the Dept. of Humanities and the core departments. Mock interviews and 
        GDs are conducted on a regular basis so as to equip final and pre-final year students to face the challenges of 
        the recruitment scenario. Close on the heels of placement drives, the Placement Assistance Cell of each department 
        makes an evaluation of the performance of the students. This objective appraisal enables us to identify the strengths 
        and weaknesses of the candidates and select strategies for improvement. Besides, we extend intensive supportive 
        measures to the rejected candidates.
